# extens.io

extens.io is an open-source governance Node.js ecosystem to make a new kind of realtime web applications build on top of the Sails framework.

Sails is the framework. Build on top of the Sails framework using the extens.io ecosystem means your application requires Sails and you trust extens.io to give you more features, hooks, updates, etc.


## Notes

This is a developer preview and not ready for production yet. A lot of work still need to be done. Please see our [roadmap](ROADMAP.md) to have more information about our plans.

We currently require our ecosystem dependencies from GitHub but we'll create a npm registry for the alpha version.

Documentation will come soon. In the meantime, you can access the official Sails documentation is here: [http://sailsjs.org/#/documentation](http://sailsjs.org/#/documentation).


## Getting started

### Basics

You can install the whole ecosystem simply by running:

```bash
$ npm install extens.io -g
```

Create and lift your first application with:

```bash
$ extens.io new myApp [--no-frontend]
$ cd myApp
$ extens.io lift
```

You can access your admin dashboard at [http://localhost:1337/sails-admin/](http://localhost:1337/sails-admin/).


### Cool command lines

Access the Sails console with:

```bash
$ cd myApp
$ extens.io console
```
