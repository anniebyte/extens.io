# Open-source governance

## Technical Committee

The extens.io project is jointly governed by a Technical Committee (TC) which is responsible for high-level guidance of the project.

The TC has final authority over this project including:

* Technical direction
* Project governance and process (including this policy)
* Contribution policy
* GitHub repository hosting
* Conduct guidelines
* Maintaining the list of additional Collaborators

Initial membership invitations to the TC were given to individuals who had been active contributors to extens.io, and who have significant experience with the management of the extens.io project. Membership is expected to evolve over time according to the needs of the project.


## Collaborators

The [@extensdotio](https://github.com/extensdotio) GitHub repositories are maintained by the TC and additional Collaborators who are added by the TC on an ongoing basis.

Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are made Collaborators and given commit-access to the project. These individuals are identified by the TC and their addition as Collaborators is discussed during the weekly TC meeting.

Modifications of the contents of the [@extensdotio](https://github.com/extensdotio) repositories are made on a collaborative basis. Anybody with a GitHub account may propose a modification via pull request and it will be considered by the project Collaborators. All pull requests must be reviewed and accepted by a Collaborator with sufficient expertise who is able to take full responsibility for the change. In the case of pull requests proposed by an existing Collaborator, an additional Collaborator is required for sign-off. Consensus should be sought if additional Collaborators participate and there is disagreement around a particular modification. See _Consensus Seeking Process_ below for further detail on the consensus model used for governance.


## TC Membership

TC seats are not time-limited. There is no fixed size of the TC. However, the expected target is between 4 and 8, to ensure adequate coverage of important areas of expertise, balanced with the ability to make decisions efficiently.

There is no specific set of requirements or qualifications for TC membership beyond these rules.

The TC may add additional members to the TC by unanimous consensus.

A TC member may be removed from the TC by voluntary resignation, or by unanimous consensus of all other TC members.

If an addition or removal is proposed during a meeting, and the full TC is not in attendance to participate, then the addition or removal is added to the agenda for the subsequent meeting. This is to ensure that all members are given the opportunity to participate in all membership decisions. If a TC member is unable to attend a meeting where a planned membership decision is being made, then their consent is assumed.


## Consensus Seeking Process

The TC follows a [Consensus Seeking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus-seeking_decision-making) decision making model.

When an agenda item has appeared to reach a consensus the moderator will ask "Does anyone object?" as a final call for dissent from the consensus.

If an agenda item cannot reach a consensus a TC member can call for either a closing vote or a vote to table the issue to the next meeting. The call for a vote must be seconded by a majority of the TC or else the discussion will continue. Simple majority wins.

Note that changes to TC membership require unanimous consensus. See "TC Membership" above.
